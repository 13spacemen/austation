changes: 
  - tweak: "Mutation tox now has a minute window where you can purge the chem to avoid being changed (It functions EXACTLY like old slime mutation toxin)"
  - tweak: "Slime Mutation Toxin is replaced by Mutation Toxin since they now function 100% the same. Think of this as just a name change!"
