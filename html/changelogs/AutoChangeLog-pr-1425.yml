changes: 
  - rscadd: "The deja vu effect (previously only used by rewind camera) now resets all your limbs and damage to the point it was added after 10 seconds (as well as the original position reset)"
  - rscadd: "The deja vu effect cannot resurrect the dead, but will heal their corpse"
  - rscadd: "New limbs fall off, old ones re-attach"
  - rscadd: "Regenerative sepia cores add a deja vu effect before healing instead of a timestop"
  - rscadd: "The rewind camera rewinds 2 times to distinguish it from the regenerative core"
  - rscadd: "Androids, skeletons and zombies no longer metabolize reagents. As such they no longer benefit from healing reagents, nor are affected by poisons and toxins."
  - rscadd: "These species are now also immune to any other form of toxin damage."
  - tweak: "Milk now also heals burn damage for skeletons."
  - rscadd: "Added a new advanced surgery, Muscled Veins: it makes the patient able to survive without a heart."
  - rscadd: "Organ Smartfridges! Store your organs safely. Upgrading the matter bin will give it the ability to heal organs held within- though this does not repair organs that are currently failing, however."
  - rscadd: "Lobectomy! Not lobotomy, but cuts out a damaged lung lobe to make its performance passable. Restores a lung to working order if it was too damaged to work before, but can only be done once. The lobectomy step has a 95% chance of success, so use some form of sterilizer to ensure you don't accidentally get blood inside your patient's lungs!"
  - rscadd: "Coronary Bypass! Restores a heart to working order if it was too damaged to work before, but can only be done once. Both incising the heart and grafting the bypass have a 90% chance to succeed, and failing them will cause heart damage and massive amounts of bleeding- so be sure to work with ideal conditions, proper tools, and sterilizer!"
  - rscadd: "Organs now decay when not in a living host"
  - rscadd: "Severe heart damage increases breathing rate, and causes a heart attack on failure"
  - rscadd: "Severe lung damage increases breathing rate, and causes suffocation on failure"
  - rscadd: "Stomach damage will likely cause the owner to vomit depending on how injured the stomach is, and how much they've eaten"
  - tweak: "Brain damage effects now works similarly to the rest of the organ damage"
  - tweak: "Appendicitis will do appendix damage when in stages 3 and 4, which can cause it to burst if left
untreated"
  - tweak: "Organs heal faster the healthier the host is"
  - balance: "Defib timer has been extended to 15 minutes! Now cloning has a decent alternative. All you have to do is heal or replace failing organs e.g. mannitol on the brain, coronary bypass for the heart etc."
  - balance: "formaldehyde prevents post mortem organ decay."
  - balance: "epinepherine pens now contain 3u formaldehyde preservative."
