  - admin: "Admin verbs and tabs have been moved and reorganized all around. You should find each tab to be more intuitive and less cluttered with unrelated verbs."
  - admin: "\"Delay round end\" and \"Check Teams\" are now admin verbs, instead of options under... Check Antagonists. Seriously, why were they like that?"
  - admin: "The \"Ticket Manager\" verb now works. It's... Identical to the \"Open Ticket Browser\" verb."
  - admin: "An old and mostly unknown admin verb now features logging."
  - admin: "You can now edit team objectives from the team panel. No more removing and adding!"
