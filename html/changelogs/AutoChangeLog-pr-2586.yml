changes: 
  - tweak: "xeno queens can smack the emergency shuttle console to clear the xeno hostile environment rather than waiting it out"
  - tweak: "Xeno queens will delay the escape shuttle for a while unless they are killed"
  - tweak: "the shuttle will get auto called at the end of the timer if the queen is alive and it hasn't been called already to prevent super xeno extended rounds"
