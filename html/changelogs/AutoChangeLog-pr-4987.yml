delete-after: True
changes: 
  - tweak: "HE pipes can now cool to within 1 Kelvin of the environment instead of 20 Kelvin"
  - tweak: "HE pipes only require a temp difference of 1 degree to exchange heat, down from 20. This makes HE pipes viable for cooling/heating station rooms."
  - balance: "A knock-on effect of the HE pipe change is that space cooling is much more powerful"
