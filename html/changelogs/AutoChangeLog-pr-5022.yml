changes: 
  - bugfix: "Fixed a bug with the captain's laser which prevented it from appropriately displaying when the gun had no charge"
  - balance: "The captain's \"antique\" laser has been reduced to a 10 shot capacity, so that it is more representative of being an antique."
  - tweak: "The captain's laser is now appropriately locked behind its display case again to make it more intuitive that players are not intended to take the gun from the start of the round. The captain will be able to open this case during elevated alert levels."
  - tweak: "All display cases may now be closed even if you do not have access to the case."
