changes: 
  - tweak: "no more random confusion when hit in the head"
  - tweak: "dismemberment now uses a calculation reliant on weapon size, weight, sharpness, and force to determine when a limb is lost, instead of RNG."
  - tweak: "no more RNG on punches! punches now have fixed damage and no stun."
  - refactor: "totally changes up block chance. blocking now relies on items being held in the active hand or not, if you are walking or not, and the direction you are facing. Shields now use durability and all other items deal stamina damage to the arm holding them when blocking. Read the pr for more in-depth info."
