changes: 
  - refactor: "Change to the cloning console and machine codes for error returns"
  - bugfix: "Cloning console TG window is now automatically updated when you trigger something."
  - tweak: "Cloning console now tells which error you have failed to clone at."
  - tweak: "Cloning console now properly lets you know that you can't clone a presaved person. It has always been so, but it has not warned you."
  - bugfix: "Cloning record id is now reliably saved based on your name and mind, which fixes the record conflicts."
  - bugfix: "Cloning console displays and accepts data in cloning diskettes properly, but remember that the clonable data becomes outdated once you clone them."
  - bugfix: "Cloning console now can track the presaved person's health status."
  - tweak: "Players can't turn on the autoclone manually anymore. admin still can turn it on by variable edit. (Note that Autoclone has not ever been working, ever.)"
  - tweak: "Body only clone will not transfer your quirks anymore and transferring your brain into that body will make you lose them. This is likely a bug due to the structure of quirks. Full scan clone still keeps them, so the brain transplant trick will not work."
  - bugfix: "Experimental cloner will properly work now and they can save data records now."
  - rscadd: "Experimental clone ghost role added. It will find candidates to pick rather than just allowing all ghosts to come in. (*a clone being catatonic means no ghost wanted the role.)"
  - bugfix: "You're not allowed to scan xenomorphs anymore - they'll not be cloned as a human. Don't harass them."
