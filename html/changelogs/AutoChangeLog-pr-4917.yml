changes: 
  - tweak: "Chaplains now come with their null rods and armor beacons"
  - tweak: "Null rods have been removed from the hidden chapel locations across maps, and the chaplain's armaments beacons have been removed from ChapDrobes."
  - bugfix: "Newly spawned null rods can be reskinned and newly spawned holy armor beacons actually work (instead of deleting themselves)."
