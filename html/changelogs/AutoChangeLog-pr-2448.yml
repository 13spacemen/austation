changes: 
  - refactor: "Browser resources (images/css/javascript) will no longer be needlessly resent to all clients between rounds and reconnections"
  - tweak: "Reduced the number of single use html files saved to the Browser Resource folder (tmp12345) on player machines."
  - rscadd: "tgchat: Unread message count is now smarter and won't increase on other tabs if you have already read the same message in the active tab."
  - rscadd: "tgchat: Admin PMs are now properly annotated and can be filtered into separate tabs."
  - bugfix: "tgchat: Fix: Highlighted message overlay no longer blocks clicks. Clicking a highlighted (F) link should work as it should."
  - bugfix: "tgui: Fixed NTOS bluescreen due to calling .includes() on a stylesheet href which could be null on certain browsers."
  - code_imp: "tgchat: Chat schema bumped to version 5. All chat-related settings were reset to avoid breakage."
  - refactor: "Interface assets (js/css/images) can now be managed using an external webserver instead of byond's one at a time file transfer queue."
  - admin: "Adds admin verb toggle-cdn that allows admins to disable the external webserver asset transport and revert to the old system. Useful if the webserver backing this goes down (thanks cloudflare)."
  - config: "New config file, resources.txt, (must be loaded by an $include statement from the main config)"
  - server: "The external_rsc_urls.txt config has been moved to the main config system."
  - refactor: "tgui windows should load faster after an initial load, if using the fancy mode. Please report any breakages."
